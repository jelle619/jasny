# Hello! I'm Jasny
Clean up junk on your desktop by organising files in their appropriate folder - automatically.

## How is Jasny built?
Jasny is built with Automator. While the alpha version is using the stock GUI implementations, later versions will use the greater possibilities of AppleScript to make everything work smoother.

## What's the setup?
Download the app on any computer running macOS (might also work on older versions like OS X releases) and have fun. You might have to open the application in Automator and make some adjustments to make it work with your file structure.
